[Jun 4, 2015 21:26:42 -8-error] [] Error #9038: Loopback test error: `Operation timed out after 4022 milliseconds with 0 bytes received`. URL: `http://dev.kitlist.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`. If you need to contact your web host, tell them that when PHP tries to connect back to the site at the URL `http://dev.kitlist.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` via curl (or other fallback connection method built into WordPress) that it gets the error `Operation timed out after 4022 milliseconds with 0 bytes received`. This means that WordPress' built-in simulated cron system cannot function properly, breaking some WordPress features & subsequently some plugins. There may be a problem with the server configuration (eg local DNS problems, mod_security, etc) preventing connections from working properly.
