# Access

Access makes it easy to build membership and paid-content sites. You can choose what to display to users who donâ€™t have read access to content. You can display the standard 404 (not found) page or use a different template when access is denied. 


## Installation

1. Download from wp-types.com/account/downloads
2. Upload to wp-content/plugins
3, Activate from wp-admin/plugin.php page


## Automatically set the right permissions for your site

The WordPress permissions system is tricky, with complex inter-dependencies. Fortunately, Access hides this complexity from you, making your administration work easy.

Access will automatically set and clear required permissions for you, as you set the permissions that you need.


## Control read-access to individual pages

The Access box appears when you edit any content. You can create access-control content groups and set their read permissions for entire user roles or for individual users.


## Create custom roles

Access lets you define your own roles and choose what these roles can do in the WordPress admin. You can change the level of the role, to match its capabilities with built-in WordPress roles, or manually control capabilities.


## Fine-grained controls over the WordPress admin
Access gives you precision control over what users with custom roles can do in the WordPress admin.

You can choose which admin screen your new user roles can reach and what actions they can perform.


## Manage access to WPML and WooCommerce admin

Access integrates smoothly with WPML and WooCommerce. You will see the different capabilities for managing both WPML and WooCommerce admin options, in plain English.
 
With Access, you can create custom roles that will manage the capabilities of your multilingual and e-commerce sites, easily!
